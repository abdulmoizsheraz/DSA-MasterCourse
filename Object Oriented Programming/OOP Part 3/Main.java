        // 1. Encapsulation
        // 2. Inheritance
        // --> Types of inheritance
        // 1.Single inheritance(One class extends another class)
        // 2.Multilevel inheritance (one class extends another that extends another class)
        // 3.Multiple inheritance (one class has more than one parent class)
        // -->And it is not supported in java so what concepts fills this place in java? --->Interfaces(will be covering in other directory)
        // 4.Hierarchial Inheritance (Parent class has more than one child)
        // 5.Hybird Inheritance(Combination of single and multiple inheritance) again it will be covered in inheritance
        // 3. Polymorphism ()
        // -->Runtime  Polymorphism
        // -->Compile Time  Polymorphism / static Polymorphism(acheived via method overloading)

        // 4.Abstractions
